    EUBIN - A decent POP3 client

Eubin is a Python script to fetch emails from remote POP3 servers.
It supports secure retrieval though SSL/TLS. Also it integrates well
with external password managers (like pass).

    How to Install

Extract files from the archive and run make && make install.

 $ tar -xf eubin-1.2.1.tgz
 $ cd eubin
 $ make && sudo make install

You'll see an executable eubin installed in /usr/local/bin/.

    Configuration

First, create ".eubin" directory in your home path.

Copy the example configuration file (example@gmail.com.conf) there
and rename it to "your-email@address.conf". Then edit its content
to suit your email server.

If you have more than one email account, create a separate
configuration file for each account.

    How to Use Eubin

Just run eubin from your command line.

 $ eubin
 eubin[INFO]: Connect to mail.example.com:995 [SSL=True]
 eubin[INFO]: 0 messages retrieved (0 bytes)

If you need more verbose outputs, use "-v" option.
